 Development Environment Setup
React (JS): Ideal for creating a dynamic and responsive UI. React makes it easy to develop complex UIs with reusable components.
Install Node.js (which includes npm) to manage packages.
Set up a React project using npx create-react-app project-name.
CSS: For styling the UI, you can use standard CSS or advanced libraries like Styled Components or SASS.
API Integration: Use Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests to cryptocurrency APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance API).


2. Designing the User Interface
Focus on a responsive UI (works across devices).
Use libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to speed up design work and provide a polished look.
Features to include in your UI:
Dashboard: Display current cryptocurrency prices.
Transaction History: Show a user's past transactions.
Wallet Integration: Link to popular wallets like MetaMask.
Live Charts: Integrate with charting libraries like Chart.js or Recharts to show cryptocurrency trends.


4. API Integration
You can integrate with several cryptocurrency APIs, such as:
CoinGecko API: For general cryptocurrency data like prices and historical data.
Binance API: For real-time trading data and transactions.

axios.get('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd')
.then(response => console.log(response.data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
